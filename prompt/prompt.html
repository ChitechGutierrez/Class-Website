    <p> Tech at ChiTech is a little different then it has been in the past. Instead of having technology classes only in your Tech classes, it will be woven into your everyday classes as well. This means you will be learning about many different applications for technology on a day to day basis. So you still have dedicated technology classes, but you will be applying and learning new skills in the rest of the classes. For instance, you could be learning how to edit audio by creating and publishing a podcast, or learning geometry by making 3D models like in video games.</p>

    <p>We are in the middle of reevaluating our tech curriculum so some of this may change, but for the most part, this is what you can expect.</p>
    
    <p>As incoming freshman, you will be enrolled in a Foundational Technology course, where you learn how to work with Project Based Learning. You learn how to read and create schematics, and learn the basics of engineering. You also have the option to enroll in Computer Programming I as your elective. Here you will learn the Object Oriented Based programming method, while you learn the Ruby programming language in order to create WebApps and websites.</p>
    
    <p>Then, as a Sophomore, you can take Entrepreneurship, where you learn business fundamentals, and how to create your own startup company. There are competitions where several of our students have already won scholarships to colleges, as well as cash prizes and Macbooks. You also will have the option of taking Programming II or Multimedia Arts I. In MMAI, you will learn the basics of Photoshop, Video Editing, as well as HTML and CSS code to build websites. We have also done animation and 3D modeling in the past.</p>
    
    <p>As a Junior, you get the options of Programming III, or MMAII, where we expand on what you already learned, furthering these skills.</p>
    
    <p>Then finally, as a Senior, you will be enrolled in a Senior Capstone class. Here, you are tasked with creating and starting a business within a small group. Based on student passion and prerequisite coursework, students are placed into one of three courses: Business Startups, Graphic and Web Design, or Software Engineering. The entire class has you focused on one single, viable business idea. The Design Students, work with the User Experience (UX) approach to design and create product layouts and user interfaces. Business students utilize the Lean Startup methodology of validated learning and iterative experimentation. Designers and Programming students work together with the Ruby on Rails framework to develop a functioning prototype of your business ideas.</p>
    
    <p>There are also chances for Dual Enrollment classes, and we are working on setting up AP Computer Science classes using Chicago’s newest curriculum.
