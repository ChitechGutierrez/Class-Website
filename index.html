                    <p>In the <strong>ChiTech Senior Capstone</strong> students are tasked with creating and starting a business within a small group. Based on student passion and prerequisite coursework, students are placed into one of three courses: <strong>Business Startups, Graphic and Web Design, or Computer Programming.</strong> Students from each course form interdisciplinary teams ensuring that each has members with the necessary skillsets. Through a variety of creative thinking and problem solving exercises, teams focus on one single, viable business idea. The Design Students, taught by myself, work with the User Experience (UX) approach to design and create product layouts and user interfaces. Business students utilize the Lean Startup methodology of validated learning and iterative experimentation. Programming students work with the Ruby on Rails framework to develop a functioning pre-Alpha level working prototype.</p>

Instead of tests or exams, the students must actually create something in the form of a project in order to prove their learning. For instance, my students created an Ad Campaign for a fictional product to learn more about advertising, logo design, rhetoric and video editing.

                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        I am a tech teacher at Chicago Tech Academy. I hold a B.S. in Biological Sciences, and am pursuing a Masters in Software Engineering from DePaul University. I got my start with computers at a young age, and have always been fascinated in the different uses of computers and technology. The impact that a few lines of code can have is outstanding. I went for my Undergrad in Biology and Education, but had helped pay for school by doing some design and web development work on the side. When the opportunity presented itself to teach Tech, I jumped at it, as it helped me realize where my passions really were at. <br>
                        I am Certified in Biology, Chemistry, and Computer Science. I also have my ESL/ELL Endorsement.<br>
                        When not at work, I can be found reading, playing games or learning as much as I can about whatever I feel like learning about.
