            <p>It’s November 22, 1963. You’re in Dallas, Texas guarding the motorcade that John F. Kennedy  is attending. You’re standing nearby with the other guards, your job is to keep watch of everything, make sure there is no conflict and that everyone is safe. As you’re standing around, one of the guards tell you that they have a feeling that something is going to go wrong. He tells you about how me noticed something suspicious coming from the sixth floor of a nearby building. You think that it might be nothing, but there’s still a chance that something could go wrong. Do you go and check out the building?

<!-- Option 1A -->

        <div class="option hidden" id="opt1A">
            <p>You brush off what your friend told you and decide to continue to guard the motorcade. As you’re watching the motorcade, you hear a gunshot followed by the sound of everyone screaming. There’s people running, screaming and pushing. There’s people getting shoved to the ground being continuously stepped on. You notice that the sound of the gunshot came from the building your friend was suspicious about.  What do you do next?</p>
    
            <div id="controls">
                <button onclick="optionSelect('opt1A', 'opt2AA')" id="button2AA" type="button">Run towards the crowd to find whoever was shot</button>

You push through the crowd trying to get to who ever was shot. Once you get there, you see John F. Kennedy in the car bleeding. He gets rushed to the hospital and you later on find out that he died due to his injury. The next day after John F. Kennedy’s death, Lyndon Baines Johnson takes over as president. During his presidency he tried to do his best to lead in the way that John F. Kennedy would have done.

                    <p>After hearing the loud gun shot, you run into the building that you believe it came from. You get into the building and see everyone inside of it running outside of the building. You stop a few people and ask them where they believe it came from. Every person you ask tells you that they believe it came from the sixth floor. Once you get to the sixth floor they point towards the room. You see a man running out of the room and you jump on him. One of the other guards followed you and helped you out. You arrest the shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, and put him into a cop car where he is arrested. Once you're back outside you find out that the president was the one who was shot. He’s rushed to the hospital and dies a couple hours later due to his serious injury. The next day after John F. Kennedy’s death, Lyndon Baines Johnson takes over as president. During his presidency he tried to do his best to lead in the way that John F. Kennedy would have done.</p>

After walking around for a few minutes you decide that it was nothing and head back to the motorcade. You walk back to the area your friends are. As you’re walking back you hear a loud sound. It’s a gunshot. Everything went silent for a second until the sound of screams and loud footsteps filled the air. What do you do?

                            <p>You run towards the crowd. Everyone is screaming and freaking out. You push your way through the crowd trying to find out who was injured. As you get to the front, you see John F. Kennedy sitting in the car bleeding. Everyone is trying to make sure he is okay. He's rushed to the hospital where he later on dies due to his wound. The next day after John F. Kennedy’s death, Lyndon Baines Johnson takes over as president. During his presidency he tried to do his best to lead in the way that John F. Kennedy would have done.</p>

                            <p> You run into the building and ask people where they believe the gunshot came from. As you're running towards the room you see and man running out. You jump on him and ask for backup. They check the room and find a gun by the window. You take him into custody and he is arrested for the killing of John F. Kennedy. Kennedy is rushed to the hospital and dies a couple hours later due to his serious injury. The next day, Lyndon Baines Johnson takes over as president.

                <div class="option hidden" id="opt2BB">
                    <p>You walk into the building and begin to search around. You call one of the guards and ask them what floor they believe was suspicious. They then ask the owner of the building to tell them what floor and room they believe it was. After getting that information you go to the sixth floor and begin to look around. You find the room and barge into it, finding Lee Harvey Oswald positioned towards the window. You run towards him trying to stop him from pulling the trigger. As you push him away he pulls the trigger. It hits a person nearby, as you look out the window you notice that his target was the president. You put Lee Harvey Oswald into handcuffs and take him into custody. You contact the others and tell them what's going on and they contact the president's security. The motorcade is cut short and the president is boarded onto his plane early for his safety.  A year after the motorcade, John F. Kennedy decides to run for a second term in the 1964 election. Due to Popular votes he wins</p>
