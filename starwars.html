      <p class="content-header">The last 2 weeks of Junior Year<br/>ChiTech Class of 2017</p>

      <br>

      <p class="content-body">
          <p>It's a period of Great Excitement. Anxious Juniors, ready to be called Seniors, have won a great victory by making it through Spring 2016 Exhibition.</p>
          
          <p>While preparing for Exhibition, the Juniors struggled to get their work done. The benevolent MR. G changed the requirements of the project to try and get some of the work done in time. He has decided to make that a permanent change.</p>
          
          <p>"But what about me? I already did my work..." some of you may be asking. FEAR NOT! You will be properly accomodated for your efforts.</p>
          
          <p>Having the entire project done by the end of your next class will automatically get you an A on the project. The percentage will be based on the quality of the work. This means having already had the project in, or by completing and submitting your HTML file with your project by the end of class.</p>
          
          <p>Having just the story done but not in the HTML file, with the original requirements (Opt0, 1A-3BBB) will net you a guaranteed passing score, but no higher then a 95%. This will be graded entirely on quality of work, but you cannot score less then a 60%.</p>
          
          <p>Having only Opt0, 1A and 1B completed, but not in an HTML file still has a chance of passing. These were the modified requirements. The highest possible score you can get is a B+ (89%), but you are also guaranteed to score no less then a 60%.</p>
          
          <p><strong>All of these are contingent on the work being turned in by the end of class, and that the stories are complete. As in, there is a clear beginning, middle and end.</strong></p>
          
          <p>"Well, what happens then?" you may be thinking. "What happens the rest of the week and next week?"</p>
          
          <p>Due to the various trips, occurrences and other things, I will be providing an assignment that can help bring up any of the missing homework grades you may have. More information on that to come . . .</p>
