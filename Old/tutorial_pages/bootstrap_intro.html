            <h3>Example Website!</h3>
            <p>This site is to serve as a template for you to use. Everyone will convert their portfolio to a Bootstrap website, however it is your choice to use it, or not. </p>
            <h3>Well, what is Bootstrap?</h3>
            <p>Bootstrap is an CSS and Javascript library that was created by 2 guys at twitter. It takes all the crazy complicated website building stuff, and simplifies it. In fact, setting up that big box for the Jumbotron literally involved adding a class="jumbotron" to a div, and BAM, there it was.</p>
        </div>
       <div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <h3>Look at this Hedgehog!</h3>
                    <p>Protip: to make your website look super professional, include a picture of a hedgehog somewhere. Anywhere really. But seriously, I am joking. Bootstrap sites look very clean, and professional; but to the trained eye it appears lazy. However, at this stage, that may not be a bad thing. Knowing ho w to use Bootstrap in High School is a rare thing, and requires a lot of skill to wield. And the best part is that you can customize it using regular CSS.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <h3>Look at this OTHER Hedgehog!</h3>
                    <p>Putting the site together invovles some set up. First, you have to download and install some files from the getbootstrap.com website. You then upload the files that you downloaded.</p>
                    <h3>jQuery</h3>
                    <p>After you install each of the files to your website directory, you need to also install a Javascript library called jQuery. Installing it can be as simple as adding a line of code at the bottom of your website. More on that later.</p>

                <h3>What to add to your HTML page</h3>
                <p>For this activity, we will be using Sublime Text, which should be installed on your computers. First, make a new folder on your desktop called "boostrap_intro_YOURNAME". Open up Sublime Text. Create a new file called "index.html" and save it inside of the "boostrap_intro_YOURNAME" folder. <br>
                  You need to add the code found below to your index file. This is at the top of the website.</p>
                <h4>NOTE: You need to remove the $'s that I placed at the beginning of each line of the code so it would appear on this site.</h4>

                    </$head>
                            </p>
                <h3>Once you have added this to your HTML page:</h3>
                <p>You need to add your <$body> tag. Inside of the body tag, you need to add a div. Inside of there, add a h3 tag with your name in it. Under there, add a p tag with a paragraph from Wikipedia about hedgehogs.</p>
                <p>
                  <$body><br>
                  <$div><br>
                    <$h3>NAME<$/h3><br>
                    <$p> . . . <$/p><br>
                  <$/div><br>
                </p>
                <p>Depending on what features you want, you may have to add another script tag just before the ending body tag. For now, don't worry about it.</p>

                <h3>And then....</h3>
                <p>Find the div tag that you made earlier. Add a class="jumbotron" to that div. Once you have done so, if everything went correctly thus far, you SHOULD see something like what you see at the top of the page, with the big grey box with your name in it. Once you do, press the Prt Scr button on your keyboard to take a screenshot. Turn that screenshot into the Google Classroom assignment "Bootstrap Intro". When you are done, take a few minutes and go to <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">The Bootstrap Website</a> and explore what it has to offer.</p>
