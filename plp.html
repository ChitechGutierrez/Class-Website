                <p class="lead"><strong>What are two bright spots in your practice?</strong></p>
                    <p>I feel that I do well with creativity and classroom management. I like to think through problems and to come up with creative ideas. They may not always pan out, but I still keep trying.</p>
                    <p>Most days, I feel that I can manage a large group of students with much issue, all working on different speeds and at different stages. Somedays, not so much. However, for the most part I feel that to be a strength of mine.</p>
                    
                <p class="lead"><strong>What is one area of growth you would like to focus on for your PLP?</strong></p>
                    <p>The area I want to focus on is following through with my ideas, and doing everything I can to make sure I succeed. This includes going big with a project.</p>

                       <p>At this point, I feel I have the follow through, but it's getting a point where I am feeling stretched thin by it. It could be simply the mood I am in as I write this, but I wonder if there is a benefit to shooting down some ideas, just to make sure the best really have a chance to shine. Perhaps my focus could/should shift to refining my ideas, and being more intentional about vetting the ideas.</p>
                       
                <p class="lead"><strong>What would success in this area look like for you?</strong></p>
                    <p> Having a big, grand exhibition, where I get out of my room, and don't rely on a show and tell with a demo added on to flesh it out. I seem to go the safe route a bit, usually at the last minute. I either find I don't have the time, or I chicken out. I also want to do a truly collaborative project. I have ideas, but then talk myself out of following through, and most of them involve another teacher.
</p>
                <p class="lead"><strong>What are some supports you need to help you achieve success?</strong></p>
                    <p>I feel I need to take the time to really collaborate. That being said, when given the time, I feel that when I try, nothing gets done. If I don't take the initiative, then it doesn't happen. This is frustrating, but not the end of the world.</p> <br>
                <p class="lead"><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>2.9.16</strong></p>
                        <p>I feel stretched thin. I want to push myself in this area, but I am pushing myself it a bunch of different directions, and I worry that my classroom will suffer for it. I should be working on what my next project will be, but I don't know yet. I don't really have a clue, and this is troublesome. I know that at the last minute, I could come up with something, but it may end up being shallow, or poorly thought out as a result. My plans I have been making for a big project doesn't seem to be panning out, which is also incredibly frustrating. I have been relying on that to be the big project, and thing one to finish out the year.</p>
                        
                        <p>Perhaps I set myself up for failure by picking this as my PLP focus. I seem to have been working in different directions, including leadership, and trying to comfortably take up the role.</p>
                        
                        <p>Is it too late to change it?</p>
